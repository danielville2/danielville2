- 👋 Hi, I’m @danielville2
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science projects to solve real world problems preferably in sectors such as automotive, renewable energies, real estate and finance.   
- 🌱 I’m currently doing a Masters in Data Science & Deep Learning in Madrid.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with a company doing an internship to put my knowledge to practice in a real world situation.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am Colombian but currently living in Madrid, I like to play tenis and running.
